# Simple Word Embedding

In my quest to understand Convolutional Neural Network for Text based data, i have to understand how word embedding works.

Here i just calculate the frequency of each words in each labels/class and then presented it in a neater format than just bag of words and hopefully i'll use this format in the CNN that i will use.

I plan to add more word embedding techniques but has yet to understand techniques other than frequency.

Basically just use the WordEmbedding function that takes parameters of list of texts and list of labels, it also takes separator but i put space or " " as the default so you can ignore it.
